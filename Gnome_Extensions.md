# Gnome Extensions
## These are extensions I either use or have tried and what my thoughts are on them.

[Gtile](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/28/gtile/) - The first one I require, thanks to having a large 4K screen is something to provide tiling support. I know, I could use a tiling window manager, but I don't always want things tiled and just have a desire to use vanilla Gnome with only the extensions I need.

While Gtile doesn't offer me the option of dragging a window to a corner of the screen or using Super + arrow keys, it seemed to me to be the simplest, lightest option for getting the tiling support I want. Within Gnome Tweaks, you can modify the extension and I set the grid size to be 2x2. I don't yet have a need to have more options available such as the 4x4 or 8x8 grid options out of the box.

#### Listing some of the others I'm either using or will investigate:

[Caffeine](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/) - This is pretty standard, but I sometimes don't want the screen going to sleep on me when I'm reading or doing something else while I'm still present at the keyboard.

[Nothing to say](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1113/nothing-to-say/) - I haven't been able to test this one yet, but I should know pretty quickly once I start using this system for work due to the amount of conference calls I join. I want to be able to view the microphone status while on a call, so that's where this comes in.

[User Themes](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/) - Can't help myself but to tinker with customization at times. The Sierra Negra shell theme is a current fav.

[Gnome Shell Extension Reloader](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1137/gnome-shell-extension-reloader/) - When hooking up additional monitors, Gtile will not properly recognize them and needs to be reloaded. This is as simple a manner in the UI that I can find for just reloaded it which then allows it to function perfectly.

[GPaste](https://github.com/Keruspe/GPaste) - Clipboard manager I'm going to check out.

[TopIcons](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons/) - For system tray icons for apps that would normally have them, but Gnome doesn't like to show.

[CPUFreq](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1082/cpufreq/) - Might require TLP, but allows swapping between CPU profiles for more performance or more battery. Either this or TLP Switcher.
